My name is Sterre van der Poll. I am working at Digital Power for a little more than a year now. Besides being on an assignment at Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland, I am following this Analytics Engineering course. This is due to the fact that I want my second assignment to be more technical than my current assignment. Subsequently, I am really eager to learn more about software- and data engineering best-practices.
